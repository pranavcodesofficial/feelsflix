## 📌 Project Status

🚧 **This project is under active development.**  
New updates are coming weekly as I refine the recommendation pipeline, improve emotion detection, and explore new input modalities like facial emotion recognition.

- 🎞️ Recommends movies that match or improve emotional state
- 🔎 Uses NLP techniques like **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity**
- 🧪 Planned: integration with facial expression recognition
